## Keycloak Guides

the following is the recommended reading order of these guides for learning keycloak. after you've completed all the guides in this series, i expect you to be able to implement keycloak for user authentication onto your own client-server model web application, which in the case of this series is assumed to be ReactJS-NodeJS-ExpressJS. 

Why did i choose to focus on JS technologies? because a majority of the world's web applications are made on JS frameworks. The principles of keycloak implementation should stay the same between any other JS based front end framework/library so you can choose to use something else if you want.

I won't cover any DB material in regards to making endpoints in your backend since that isn't really within scope of these guides and i want to keep this as easy to follow as possible.
